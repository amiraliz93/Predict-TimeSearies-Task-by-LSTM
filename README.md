# Predict-TimeSearies-Task-by-LSTM

In this project I employed the LSTM model to predict Bitcoin price

In order to predict Time serieas task by Recurent neural network needs to prepare dataset suitable for RNN
After basic data prepration we need to prepare our data set suitable for LSTM and for doing this I convert dataset to 
supervised learning problem.
By doing ths we predict next price hourse base our features and last preice.
